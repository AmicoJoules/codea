## Getting started

Make sure you have a recent version of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org), and the
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) dependency management tool.

```sh
$ npm install --global yarn
```

Once these requirements are met, let's proceed and install the project dependencies.

```sh
$ cd codea-blog
$ yarn install
```

And finally, let's execute the development server:

```sh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/gatsby develop
```

You can now view blog in the browser http://localhost:8000

View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore the blog's schema http://localhost:8000/___graphql
